**Linear Regression Project**
**Objective**

The goal of this project is to implement and understand simple and multiple linear regression using Python. The project demonstrates data preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

**Tools & Libraries**

Python 3.x
Pandas – for data manipulation
NumPy – for numerical operations
Scikit-learn – for machine learning models
Matplotlib – for data visualization

**Project Files**
File	Description
**linear_regression.py**	Contains the code to train and evaluate the Linear Regression model
**dataset of housing.csv**
**README.md	** Project documentation

**Workflow**

Import and Preprocess Dataset
Load data using Pandas
Handle missing values and categorical variables if necessary
Explore dataset with summary statistics and visualizations
Train-Test Split
Split the dataset into training and testing sets to evaluate model performance
Fit Linear Regression Model
Use LinearRegression from Scikit-learn
Train the model on the training data
Model Evaluation
Evaluate the model using metrics:
Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
Mean Squared Error (MSE)
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)
R² Score (Coefficient of Determination)
Interpret Coefficients
Analyze feature importance from the model coefficients
Plot Regression Line
Visualize the regression line for simple linear regression
